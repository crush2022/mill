Types of Piles & Classification of Piles in Construction. When the concrete hardens,the prestress cables are cut,with the tension force in the cables now producing compressive stress in the concrete pile.It is common to higher strength concrete (35 to 55 MPa) in prestressed piles because of the large initial compressive stresses from prestressing. Durability of Concrete Types of Durability and Factors. Durability is defined as the capability of concrete to resist weathering action,chemical attack and abrasion while maintaining its desired engineering properties.It normally refers to the duration or life span of trouble free performance.Different concretes require different degrees of durability depending on the exposure environment and properties desired.
