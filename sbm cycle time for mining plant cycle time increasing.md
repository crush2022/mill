For instance,increasing the processing time at a workstation increases that workstation's manufacturing cycle time but could reduce the yield (and the throughput) and the total manufacturing cycle time.Also,increasing the arrival rate increases the total manufacturing cycle time. Mining yield EVE University Wiki Mining yield is the rate at which miners mine ore,ice,or gas.As all mining modules mine a certain volume of ore ice gas in a given time,the amount of ore ice gas mined therefore depends on this mining rate (often quoted in m 3 per minute) and on the volume of the ore ice gas (m 3) being mined. Viewpoint Mining Magazine Improving efficiency underground Total Time — Sum of all the above (a full cycle) " Go into the mine and conduct a one to two hour production study," Widdifield suggests."It doesn't matter if you sit on a rock with a stop watch,ride in the truck with an operator,or use technology to evaluate performance.
