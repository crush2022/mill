Mineral Process,Mineral Processing of Gold,Mineral. As the common mineral processing process,the froth flotation method is widely used in the concentrator.Because the froth flotation method is strict with grinding fineness,pulp density,flotation reagent,the flotation plant operators must inspect the flotation conditions during the operation of flotation machine. Grinding and flotation pulp chemistry of a low grade. The response parameters in flotation are dependent,among other factors,upon the pulp chemical condition right from the stage of grinding through flotation.The present work deals with the results of investigations carried out at different stages in the grinding and flotation circuits of a plant,treating a low grade copper ore. Froth Flotation Process Mineral Processing & Metallurgy Here is a trick for knowing if your flotation feed grind size is fine enough to achieve adequate mineral liberation without doing a full mineralogy study.If your key mineral is sufficiently liberated,it should float and be recovered in the first few minutes in an initial %mass that stabilizes quickly = the green curve.If,your valuable minerals are still badly locked,the longer you float.
