Abstract：Based on the division of water systems in the Xiaoqinling gold ore district,the authors studied the concentrations and distribution of seven kinds of heavy metals i.e.Hg,Pb,Cd,Cr,As,Cu and Zn,in the stream sediments and,in the light of the source Contrasting regimes of Cu,Zn and Pb transport in ore. The predicted Cu,Pb,and Zn concentrations compare well with natural geofluids,and therefore the model fluids can be applied to investigate hydrothermal ore forming process.(2) In both low and high salinity fluids,Cu,Pb and Zn are transported as hydrosulfide complexes at high temperature,but as chloride complexes at low temperature. 12.Supergene Ore and Gangue Characteristics Supergene Ore and Gangue Characteristics By Randolph A.Koski.developed on VMS deposits,especially deposits rich in Zn,Pb,and As (table 12 1).The thicknesses of individual zones.native gold Au electrum (Au,Ag) native copper Cu atacamite Cu.2.Cl(OH) 3.188 12.Supergene Ore.
